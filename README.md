## Hello_Functions

### Description 

In Hello Functions we used the Ultrasonic Sensor to see if there is anything within a certian distance, and if so the servo would move.  Also if they were closer than an even shorter distance, it would move faster. The objective of his project was to use functions for the first time.

### Lessons Learned

Functions are incredibly helpful in code.  They consilidate your code and make it more readible.  When in doubt look at the CHS Sigma Wiki.  It help develop my understanding of functions in code.

*  his line of code is your savior (distance = (duration/2) *0.034/2;)

## New Ping 

### Description 

In New Ping we were to use the New ping library to do a certian task with the ultrsonic sensor. In my code I had the Ultrasonic sensor send out and depending on the distance it would do different actions.  If the distance was greater than 10 cm The servo would move.  If the distance was less than 5 cm the servo would move faster and the LED would fade in and out.  Finally, if the distance was between 5 and 10 cm everything would stop.

### Lessons Learned 

I didn't understand how to use new ping. Looking at the CHS Sigma wiki as well as watching the video below helped me get a better understanding of new ping.
